        [Verse 1]
        I used to float, now I just fall down
        I used to know, but I'm not sure now
        What I was made for
        What was I made for?
        
        [Verse 2]
        Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
        Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
        Just somethin' you paid for
        What was I made for?
        
        [Chorus]
        'Cause I, I
        I don't know how to feel
        But I wanna try
        I don't know how to feel
        But someday, I might
        Someday, I might
        
        [Post-Chorus]
        Mm, mm, ah
        Mm, mm, mm

        [Verse 3]
        When did it end? All the enjoyment
        I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
        It's not what he's made for
        What was I made for?
